### 👋 Hi, I'm {{ firstName }} {{ lastName }}

Welcome to my portfolio page! <br>
Here you can get a quick peek into my background, interests and *„skills“*.

### 🚀 Quick Facts
- **Location:** {{ geoLocation }}
- **Profession:** {{ industry }}
- **Interests:** Coding, Open Source, Gaming, <sub class="text-muted">(occasionally avoiding people)</sub>
- **Contact:** [hi@adam-sandler.de]

### 🧑‍💻 Background
I got into programming pretty early on, somewhere around 13 or 14, and quickly <br>
got hooked on the idea that you can build basically *anything* with code.

Specially web development grabbed me because, compared to stuff <br>
like **JavaFX** or **C# WPF**, things mostly just *„work“* (unless you’re unlucky enough to touch **ExtJs**).

I’ve also always been drawn to making games - or, more realistically starting them and abandoning <br>
them halfway through.

In my opinion, games leave so much more room for creativity *(random things)* then other dev areas.<br>
Plus I just like playing games myself.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Vue.js / Nuxt
- Rust (rarely.. but sometimes)
- Piano playing 🎹
- Unreal 5

### 💡 Fun Fact
This page is proudly **not** made with ExtJs.
